PHP5.3 Textmate Bundle
======================

This bundle includes a new syntax file for Textmate that supports
highlighting of PHP5.3 constructs (nowdoc and namespaces).

It should be stable and I do not intend to maintain it.

Installation
============

Clone or download the bundle and place it in ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
